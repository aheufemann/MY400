# Questions from the Lecture?


# Questions about causal inference from last week? 



# Today's Agenda 

- Topic: **Meaning-Making in Qualitative Research**

- Objectives:

  - Discuss the weekly reading
  - Discuss the Summative Assessment
  - Discuss whatever needs clarification 



# Weekly Reading Overview

**Susewind, R. (2021)**  
*"Dreaming in the Shadow of History: Micro-Mobilities and Belonging in Lucknow"*

Key Takeaways:

- Focus on **micro-mobilities** and their role in shaping belonging.
- Methodology: Ethnographic fieldwork and life histories.
- Concepts: Belonging, urban mobility, and aspirations.



# Background and Literature Review

**Gaps Identified:**

- Existing research emphasizes **long-distance mobility**.
- This study highlights **short-distance, mundane mobilities**.

**Contributions:**

- Builds on the "mobilities paradigm" (e.g., Bissell, Urry).
- Explores ambivalence and ambiguities of belonging.

**Discussion Questions:**

- What literature does the study expand on?
- How does it challenge "gap narratives"?





# Research Design

**Case Selection:**

- Why Lucknow? Rich relationships and pragmatic access.
- Does the choice justify the aims of the study?

**Design Approach:**

- Abductive reasoning.
- Combines temporal, spatial, and embodied narratives.

**Discussion Prompt:**

- Is the case selection convincing? Why or why not?


# Data Collection and Analysis

**Methods Used:**

- Walking/driving interviews.
- Participant observation.
- Embodied co-presence.

**Data Analysis:**

- Limited explicit description in the paper.

**Activity:**

- Propose alternative data collection strategies for a similar study.
- How would you improve the data analysis section?



# Outcomes and Contributions

**Key Insights:**

- Micro-mobilities matter in urban belonging.
- Highlights the interplay of inclusion/exclusion and ambivalence.

**Social Relevance:**

- Resonates with Covid-19 "lockdown" experiences.
- Implications for modern urban studies.

**Discussion:**

- Does this research resonate with your own experiences?


# Group Activity

<br>

**Designing a Qualitative Study:**

- Choose a research question from your peers 
- Develop a research design for a qualitative study 
  - Case selection, data collection, and analysis
- Include risks/limitations and ethical considerations



# Summative Assessment


# Summative Assessment

- 3,000-word Research design worth 100% of the grade
- Word count does not include references/title/appendix, but does include tables/figures

**Submission Deadline: Monday 20th January 2025, 4pm**
