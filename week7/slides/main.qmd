# From research questions to research designs

**Today**

- Peer review project


# Questions from the Lecture?




# Peer Review Project 


- Groups of 2-3 students
  - Don't pair up with your pal  
- Use peer review criteria to evaluate each other's work
- Provide the feedback in a written form to the author 
- **Be constructive, be specific, and be kind**




**Research problem**

- In what ways is the problem motivating the research clear?  
- Is the interest of the research problem clearly demonstrated?  
- Is there a puzzle/tension clearly identified?  

**Literature review:**

- Are relevant bodies of literature clearly identified? 
- Are there synthesised in a way that shed light on the existing arguments, positions and traditions or is it merely a list of publications? 

**Positioning/originality:**

- In what ways is the gap in knowledge clearly addressed?
- Is the originality of the project emphasised enough? 


**Research question**

- Is the research question clearly formulated?
- Does the question “naturally” follow from the rest of the assignment? 
- Is it formulated in a way that matches the objectives of the project? 

**Overall coherence** 

- How coherent is the project outline as a whole? For example:  
  - Does the research question address align with the issues/actors/concepts than the research problem and literature?
