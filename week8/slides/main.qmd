# Questions from the Lecture?






# Introduction to Case Studies

<br>

**Key Questions**:

- What is a case study?
  - Definition - A case study is an intensive study of a single unit with an aim to generalize across a larger set of units (Gerring, 2004)

- Why are case studies important in research design?
  - Justification
  - Comparison
  - Relevance 
  - Not a matter of qual. vs. quant. research 

**Discussion**:

- What comes to mind when you hear "case study"? 
  - Share an example from your field of study.



# Justifying Case Selection



**Key Points**:

- Justification applies to all research designs (quantitative and qualitative)
- Case selection should align with the research question and theoretical gap

**Group Activity**:

- In pairs, brainstorm how have you justified the selection of your specific case (e.g., a country, policy, or organization) in your research proposal. Share with the class.



# Justifying Case Selection

**Reading**: *“You’re not my nanny!” Responses to racialized women leaders during COVID-19* (Calasanti & Gerrits, 2023)

- Which cases do the authors select? 
- How do the authors justify their case selection?
- Is this selection process compelling?
- How could the authors improve their justification?



# Case Study Design

<br>

**Reading**: *“You’re not my nanny!” Responses to racialized women leaders during COVID-19* (Calasanti & Gerrits, 2023)

<br>

In the research design, the study does not explicitly identify its comparison as a most similar or most different design. Would it be more compelling if it discussed more about the mode of comparison? How and why? 




# Comparative Case Studies

<br>

**Key Insight**:

- When comparing cases, the goal is to draw theoretical insights from the comparison
- Cases can be similar or different in various ways (e.g., context, outcome, process)
- The choice of comparison shapes the research outcomes

<br>

**Discussion**:

- In pairs, outline a comparative case study design for a research question in your field. Discuss:

  - What are the cases?
  - How are they similar or different?
  - What theoretical insights can be drawn from the comparison?



# A Case of What? 

<br>

**Key Insight**: Research is not solely about the case itself but what it represents

<br>

**Group Activity**:

A case of what?

- The Rise of TikTok as a Tool for Political Mobilization Among Gen Z in the 2020 US Presidential Election
- The Impact of Remote Work Policies on Urban-Rural Migration in Post-COVID Economies
- How Anti-Vaccine Movements Spread Through Telegram in Eastern Europe
- The Effect of Universal Basic Income Pilots on Gender Roles in Rural Kenyan Communities
- Protests Against Police Brutality in Nigeria: The #EndSARS Movement and Its International Resonance




# Reflect and Share

**Key Takeaways**:

- Case studies bridge theoretical and empirical insights.
- Justification is critical for credibility.
- Design choices shape research outcomes.

**Group Activity**:

- Reflect: What challenges do you foresee in selecting and justifying your case(s)? Share with the class.



# Next week - Week 9

- Description and prediction in quantitative and computational research
- Office hours will be on Wednesday 10-12pm
- If you need to speak outside of these hours, please email me to arrange a meeting
  - Please don't be shy about sending me a reminder email if I don't respond within 24 hours
