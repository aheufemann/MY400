# Questions from the Lecture?






# Introduction to Case Studies

<br>

**Key Questions**:

- What is a case study?
  - Definition - A case study is an intensive study of a single unit with an aim to generalize across a larger set of units (Gerring, 2004)

- Why are case studies important in research design?
  - Justification
  - Comparison
  - Relevance 
  - Not a matter of qual. vs. quant. research 

**Discussion**:

- What comes to mind when you hear "case study"? 
  - Share an example from your field of study.



# Theoretical Framing of a Case Study

<br>


**Key Insight** (Gerring, 2004):
"A case study is an intensive study of a single unit with an aim to generalize across a larger set of units."



**Group Activity**:

- Reflect: How can a single unit inform broader theoretical insights? 
  - Choose a case you are familiar with and discuss its broader implications.


# The Importance of Context

<br>

**Discussion**:

- A case is not inherently a country, city, or policy. It depends on the level of analysis and research aims

**Group Activity**:

- Identify a topic in your field. What levels of analysis (e.g., country, organization, group) could it represent? Discuss with your group why one level might be more suitable than others


# Justifying Case Selection



**Key Points**:

- Justification applies to all research designs (quantitative and qualitative)
- Case selection should align with the research question and theoretical gap

**Group Activity**:

- In pairs, brainstorm how have you justified the selection of your specific case (e.g., a country, policy, or organization) in your research proposal. Share with the class.





# Case Selection in Practice

<br>

**Example** 

*“You’re not my nanny!” Responses to racialized women leaders during COVID-19, Politics, Groups, and Identities* (Calasanti & Gerrits, 2023)


- Case: Twitter responses to two racialized women leaders during COVID-19
- Justification: Relevance to understanding intersectional backlash

**Group Activity**:

- How do the authors justify their case selection?
- What makes this case selection compelling? 
- How could the authors improve their justification?







# Designing Comparative Case Studies

<br>

**Key Insight**:

- Comparative case studies can offer insights into causal mechanisms and generalizability.

**Group Activity**:

- In pairs, outline a comparative case study design for a research question in your field. Discuss:

  - What are the cases?
  - How are they similar or different?
  - What theoretical insights can be drawn from the comparison?



# A Case of What? 

<br>

**Key Insight**: Research is not solely about the case itself but what it represents

<br>

**Group Activity**:

A case of what?

- The Rise of TikTok as a Tool for Political Mobilization Among Gen Z in the 2020 US Presidential Election
- The Impact of Remote Work Policies on Urban-Rural Migration in Post-COVID Economies
- How Anti-Vaccine Movements Spread Through Telegram in Eastern Europe
- The Effect of Universal Basic Income Pilots on Gender Roles in Rural Kenyan Communities
- Protests Against Police Brutality in Nigeria: The #EndSARS Movement and Its International Resonance




# Reflect and Share

**Key Takeaways**:

- Case studies bridge theoretical and empirical insights.
- Justification is critical for credibility.
- Design choices shape research outcomes.

**Group Activity**:

- Reflect: What challenges do you foresee in selecting and justifying your case(s)? Share with the class.



# Next week - Week 9

- Description and prediction in quantitative and computational research
- Office hours will be on Wednesday 10-12pm
- If you need to speak outside of these hours, please email me to arrange a meeting
  - Please don't be shy about sending me a reminder email if I don't respond within 24 hours
