# From research questions to research designs

**Today**

- Connecting research questions to research designs
- Cover Dietrich & Sands (2023) as an example of a research design
  - Group activity: Designing a field experiment
- Discuss the formative assignment
- If time: opportunity to share progress on research proposals


# Questions from the Lecture?





# Linking questions and designs 

<br>

*Seeing racial avoidance on New York City streets* (Dietrich & Sands, 2023)

<br>

- Key question: How do public encounters vary based on race?
- Study relevance: The use of traffic cameras and confederates allows for **real-world**, **unobtrusive measurement**.
- Findings: Pedestrians gave a wider berth to Black confederates compared to white.


# Theoretical Motivation

<br>

*Let's think about the theoretical motivation for the study - how do the authors situate their work?*

<br>


- **Institutional racism and segregation**: Discrimination is built into the structure of society, often through laws, policies, and practices

- **Implicit racial bias**: Unconscious attitudes or stereotypes that affect our understanding, actions, and decisions [@dovidio2002implicit; @word1974nonverbal; @dovidio1997nature] 

- **Racial avoidance theory**: The tendency to avoid interactions with individuals of a different [@willis1966initial; @hendricks1976race; @brown1981shared]



# Research Question: Observing Racial Avoidance

- **Central Research Question**: Do people exhibit different behaviors in public spaces based on racial out-group presence?

- **Sub-Questions**:
  - How do pedestrians adjust their paths when encountering Black vs. white individuals?
  - Are these behaviors consistent across different racial groups?
  - Are there gender differences in these behaviors?
  - What are the implications of these behaviors for social interactions and urban life?


# How do the authors connect theory to their research question?

- **Racial Avoidance Theory**: Suggests that people may avoid interactions with individuals
  - **Implicit Bias**: Unconscious attitudes may influence these behaviors
  - **Non-Verbal Bias**: Racial bias may manifest in non-verbal behaviors, such as physical avoidance



# Connecting Question to Research Design

- **Research Design**: Naturalistic field experiment using NYC traffic cameras
  - Observations of pedestrian behavior in real-world settings
  - Deductive approach: Testing theoretical predictions in a naturalistic context
    - e.g. pre-registering the study design and hypotheses
  - Unobtrusive observation: Minimizing participant awareness to capture implicit behaviors

- **Field Experiment Setup**: Confederates were stationed on NYC sidewalks, with careful controls over racial presentation.
- Design used NYC DOT traffic cameras, providing **naturalistic observation**.
- This design aligns with the question by providing **large-scale data** without participant awareness.


# How do the authors justify their research design?

- Background: Prior studies show **racial bias** in conversation distance and space use but often rely on lab settings.

- **Strengths of the Design**:
  - **Real-World Context**: Captures **implicit racial bias** in everyday interactions
  - **Unobtrusive Observation**: Minimizes participant awareness for more accurate data
  - **Large-Scale Data**: Uses NYC traffic cameras for **naturalistic observation**

- **Alignment with Research Question**: Design allows for the study of **non-verbal racial bias** in public spaces.


# Measurement and Data Collection


- Data Sources: Publicly available NYC traffic camera feeds
  - **Observational Data**: Captured pedestrian behaviors in real-time

- **Confederate Setup**: Black and white confederates stationed on sidewalks
  - **Controlled Presentation**: Confederates wore similar clothing and stood in similar locations 
      - **Why is this important?**
- **Outcome Measure**: Standardized Pedestrian Deviation (SPD) – how far pedestrians veered from confederates.
  - How do they come up with this measure? 
     - Validation 


# Data Analysis

- **Statistical Analysis**: Used difference-in-means, OLS, and covariate-adjusted effects
  - **Subgroup Analysis**: Examined effects across different racial groups
    - **Estimated effects for women responding to men**: why? 
  - **Clustered Analysis**: Managed dependencies within time blocks 
    - why is this important in this context?

# Key Findings: Racial Avoidance on NYC Sidewalks


- **Main Results**: Pedestrians gave a wider berth to Black confederates compared to white.
  - Effects were especially notable in **non-Black pedestrians**.
  - How can we interpret these results?

# Implications for Research Design

- Demonstrates how carefully structured experiments can capture subtle, real-world behaviors
- Highlights the need to **align methodology** with research goals – here, unobtrusive observation matched the goal of measuring **implicit racial bias**
- Potential for **replication** in other cities or with different variables, showing the flexibility of the research design

# Conclusion: Connecting Design with Broader Implications

- Research design should facilitate findings that address the core question
- Dietrich & Sands' study illustrates the importance of context-specific design in studying **social interactions**
- As a tool for future research, this design can inform studies on **non-verbal racial bias** and other forms of implicit behavior


# Discussion Activity: Designing a Field Experiment

- In groups, outline a field experiment on a chosen social behavior (e.g., helping behavior, seating choice) with a similar unobtrusive design.
- Key considerations:
  - What public space could be observed?
  - What variables would you control?
  - How would you address potential ethical concerns?


# Formative Assignment: Research Proposals 


- **Submission Deadline:* Thursday 7th November, 4pm
- **Length:** 1-2 pages including in-text citations and reference list
- **Format:** Word or PDF
- **Submission:** Via Moodle
- **Not mandatory, but highly recommended**


# Formative Assignment: Research Proposals

**Contents:**

- Introduction: Research question and rationale (1-2 paragraphs)
- Literature Review: Key theories and prior research (3-4 paragraphs)
- Methodology: Research design, data collection, and analysis plan (3-4 paragraphs)


# Formative Assignment: Research Questions 

- **Research Question:** What is the central question you are seeking to answer in your research proposal?

- **Rationale:** Why is this question important? What gap in the literature does it address?

*Your research questions can be set out in paragraph or list form – either way, they should be posed as questions and should clearly be motivated by or lead on from the preceding literature review.*


# Formative Assignment: Literature Review

- **Key Theories:** What are the main theoretical frameworks that inform your research question?
- **Prior Research:** What are the key studies that have addressed similar questions or used similar methods?
- **Gaps in the Literature:** What are the limitations of prior research that your study will address?


# Formative Assignment: Methodology

- **Research Design:** What is the overall design of your study? What methods will you use to collect data?
   - will you use an inductive, deductive or abductive approach?
   - will it be a qualitative, quantitative or mixed-methods study?
- **Data Collection:** How will you collect data? What are the key variables you will measure?
   - will you use primary or secondary data?
   - will you use surveys, interviews, experiments, or observational data?

- **Analysis Plan:** How will you analyze your data? What statistical methods will you use?


# Revision Meme: 

- **Task:** Create a meme that summarizes the key principles of research design.
- **Purpose:** To motivate you to revise the first part of the module and to create a collective meme bank to help you remember important principles of research design.
- **Submission:** Post your meme on the 'Meme your research design' blog created for the module


# Questions about the formative assignment or the revision meme?

# Does anyone want to share their progress on the research proposal?


# Next week is Reading Week

- Office hours will be available for those who want to discuss their research proposals
- No seminar next week
