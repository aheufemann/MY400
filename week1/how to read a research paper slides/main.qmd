# How to read a paper/article

- Plan at least **3-6 hours** to read a paper fully.
- **Take several passes** through the paper to extract different levels of information.
- You don't need to read the paper in a linear way from start to finish!

**While reading, ask yourself:**

- What is the author trying to say?
- What motivates the exploration of this topic?
- What does the research contribute?
- What are the main arguments?

# How to read a paper/article - AIC Approach

1. **Start with the Abstract, Introduction, and Conclusion (AIC)**
   - Read Title, Abstract, and Introduction first.
   - Understand the main goals and context.
2. Read the **Conclusion**:
   - Get a summary of the study's findings.
3. **Examine graphs and figures** to understand what the authors highlight.
4. For this course, **focus on the Methodology** to understand the research design.

# Reading in Depth

- After AIC, start from the beginning.
- Take **notes** for each section:
  - **Introduction**: Write a summary.
  - **Methodology**: Write a summary.
- Don't worry if you donâ€™t fully understand graphs, figures and tables initially.


# Generating Questions

- Reading is an **active task**:
  - Who are the authors?
  - What problem does the research address?
  - Is the method used the best one?
  - What are the findings and applications?
