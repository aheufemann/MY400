# Week 4 – Desk-Based Research

# Questions from the Lecture

- Any lingering questions from the lecture?
- Let's discuss any confusing points (5 minutes)



# What is a Literature Review?
- A literature review **summarizes and evaluates** a body of writings on a specific topic.
- Two key components:
  - **Summary** of prior research findings or claims.
  - **Evaluation** of the accuracy, completeness, and gaps in the literature.
- It is not just a list of summaries, but a **synthesis** of the existing research.



# Benefits of Conducting a Literature Review
- Provides a **general overview** of unfamiliar research.
- Helps avoid **reinventing the wheel** by identifying what has already been done.
- Generates **new ideas** and reveals **flaws** or gaps in existing research.
- **Places your research in context**, highlighting potential contributions.



# Three Contexts for Literature Reviews
1. **Standalone Review**: Summarizes current knowledge on a topic (e.g., state-of-the-art reviews).
2. **Preliminary Stage**: A required part of research proposals or theses, helping to frame contributions to knowledge.
3. **Component of a Finished Report**: Builds upon the proposal review to link final conclusions to previous literature.



# Framing Contributions to Knowledge
- Knowledge refers to both **beliefs** and the **confidence** with which we hold them.
- Literature reviews can:
  - **Introduce new ideas**, theories, or information.
  - **Alter existing beliefs** or challenge the confidence in those beliefs.
  - Strengthen or challenge the current understanding of a topic.



# Tips for Creating an Effective Literature Review
1. **Be selective** focus on studies relevant to your research.
2. **Organize by themes** group studies into schools of thought or theories.
3. **Critically assess** the assumptions, logic, evidence, and methodologies of the studies.
4. Identify **areas of consensus, debate, and gaps** to frame your research's contribution.



# To summarize...

Knopf (2006) highlights the role of literature reviews:

- **Concise summary** of prior studies.
- **Assessment** of the "state-of-the-art" in the field.
- Identification of **strengths, weaknesses, and gaps**.

**Key Questions** to ask when reviewing:

- What is each publication trying to achieve?
- What is the main argument in each publication?
- What are the areas of consensus or disagreement?
- What are the gaps in the current knowledge?
  - What kinds of questions remain unanswered?







## *Using Facebook ad data to track the global digital gender gap*

**Abstract:**

*Gender equality in access to the internet and mobile phones has become increasingly recognized as a development goal. Monitoring progress towards this goal however is challenging due to the limited availability of gender-disaggregated data, particularly in low-income countries. In this data sparse context, we examine the potential of a source of digital trace ‘big data’ – Facebook’s advertisement audience estimates – that provides aggregate data on Facebook users by demographic characteristics covering the platform’s over 2 billion users to measure and nowcast digital gender gaps. We generate a unique country-level dataset combining ‘online’ indicators of Facebook users by gender, age and device type, ‘offline’ indicators related to a country’s overall development and gender gaps, and official data on gender gaps in internet and mobile access where available. Using this dataset, we predict internet and mobile phone gender gaps from official data using online indicators, as well as online and offline indicators. We find that the online Facebook gender gap indicators are highly correlated with official statistics on internet and mobile phone gender gaps. For internet gender gaps, models using Facebook data do better than those using offline indicators alone. Models combining online and offline variables however have the highest predictive power. Our approach demonstrates the feasibility of using Facebook data for real-time tracking of digital gender gaps. It enables us to improve geographical coverage for an important development indicator, with the biggest gains made for low-income countries for which existing data are most limited.*


# Example Research Outline

- **Motivation:​** 
   - Unequal access across the world (and within countries) to crucial information and communication technologies (ICTs), like access to internet and mobile phones. 
   - Gender is a key dimension of inequality, but we don’t have adequate data world-wide, especially in low- and middle-income countries. ​

- **Discipline/Fields:**
   - Political Science
   - Data Science/Computational Social Science
   - World Development and the digital divide​

- **Literature Topic 1:​**
   - On the proliferation and growing importance of ICTs across the world, revolutionizing social, cultural and political life. 
   - ICTs are shown to be crucial to achieving key development goals (“lowers the cost of information and connectivity”), especially for marginalized groups, such as women in some low-income countries. ​

- **Literature Topic 2:​** 
   - Gender gaps – what we know about the magnitude and persistence, and what key predictors/explanations there are in the literature​

- **Literature Topic 3:​**
   - Data Science/Computational Social Science techniques to fit models on ‘training data’, cross-validation, and out-of-sample predictions. ​


# Example Research Outline (cont.)

**Research Question(s):​** 

- Can both sets of data be used to estimate gender gaps in internet and mobile phone access in countries across the world that we do not already have good data on?​
- Do these data explain variation in gender gaps in the countries that we do have good data on (the ‘training’ dataset)?​
- If so, can we use the models to make ‘out-of-sample’ predictions in countries that we do not have good data on?



# Group Activity: Sketching a Literature Review 


1. **Choose a discipline** and **research topic**
2. Identify an **early research question**.
3. Outline **three relevant topics** for the literature review:
   - Example: Gender gaps in ICT, predictors, and data modeling techniques.
4. Use **Google Scholar** to find at least 3 sources.
5. Summarize key points and share with the class.

**No methods/analysis needed, just a summary of the literature.**


# Group Activity: Research Topics

**Choose a Research Topic:**

1. **Social Media and Mental Health**
   - Example questions: How does social media impact teenage mental health?
2. **Aging Population and Social Support Systems**
   - Example questions: How do social support systems change with an aging population?
3. **Public Ethics and AI**
   - Example questions: How does the public perceive AI making ethical judgments?
4. **Climate Change and Radical Right**
   - Example questions: How do radical right parties frame climate change?





# Individual Activity: Sketching a Literature Review 


1. **Choose a discipline** and **research topic**
2. Identify an **early research question**.
3. Outline **three relevant topics** for the literature review:
   - Example: Gender gaps in ICT, predictors, and data modeling techniques.
4. Use **Google Scholar** to find at least 3 sources.
5. Summarize key gaps, contributions and methods to share with the class.

**No methods/analysis needed, just a summary of the literature.**


## Concluding Thoughts

- Literature reviews form the backbone of **desk-based research**.
- Identifying **gaps** and **building upon prior work** is crucial.
- Keep your research **focused** and **critical**.

---

## Final Activity: Peer Review - Optional

- Exchange your literature review outline with a peer.
- Provide feedback on clarity and relevance.



# Next Steps

- **Prepare for next week's seminar**:
  - From research questions to research designs
  - Keep thinking about how your own research proposal is taking shape

**Any final questions or reflections?**
