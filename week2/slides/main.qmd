# How to read a paper/article

- Plan at least **3-6 hours** to read a paper fully.
- **Take several passes** through the paper to extract different levels of information.
- You don't need to read the paper in a linear way from start to finish!

**While reading, ask yourself:**

- What is the author trying to say?
- What motivates the exploration of this topic?
- What does the research contribute?
- What are the main arguments?

# AIC Approach

1. **Start with the Abstract, Introduction, and Conclusion (AIC)**
   - Read Title, Abstract, and Introduction first.
   - Understand the main goals and context.
2. Read the **Conclusion**:
   - Get a summary of the study's findings.
3. **Examine graphs and figures** to understand what the authors highlight.
4. For this course, **focus on the Methodology** to understand the research design.


# Reading in Depth

- After AIC, start from the beginning.
- Take **notes** for each section:
  - **Introduction**: Write a summary.
  - **Methodology**: Write a summary.
- Don't worry if you donâ€™t fully understand graphs, figures and tables initially.


# Generating Questions

- Reading is an **active task**:
  - Who are the authors?
  - What problem does the research address?
  - Is the method used the best one?
  - What are the findings and applications?

# To summarise

- We learn what has been done before, which is fundamental to cumulative knowledge;
- We acquire language to speak about it, such as concepts;
- We expand our imagination about what it is possible to do in relation to our topic of interest or the phenomenon we want to investigate;
- We become more critical about what looks convincing and what does not;
- We acquire models and templates that we can use as examples in our own research (which is different from plagiarism!)



# Discussion Activities


- Split into groups to discuss seminar questions
- 1-2 each week
	- one will include the essential reading 




# Discussion 1     


- Is your experience of reading academic articles similar to the strategies presented by the teacher?
  - What are the main differences between your approach and the one presented?

Discussion Activity 2

# Discussion 2



- What are the key differences between gap-spotting and problematization in constructing research questions?
	- Discuss the extent to which each approach impacts the development of significant and innovative theories in organizational studies.

# Discussion 2



- Why is gap-spotting the dominant approach in research question formulation, despite the emphasis on theory challenging for creating interesting research?
	- What social norms or academic pressures reinforce the preference for gap-spotting and to what extent do the authors provide answers to these questions in the text?

# Discussion 2


- Are there other ways of motivating research questions you can think of that the authors do not attend to? 
  - Following how the authors name the approaches to gap-spotting they identify, how would you name them?

# Discussion 2


- In what ways do institutional norms, such as journal publication standards and academia's reward systems, shape the construction of research questions?
	- How might these norms hinder more critical and disruptive research approaches?

# Discussion 2



- How can researchers balance the need for academic credibility with the pursuit of innovative, assumption-challenging research questions?
	- Discuss strategies that might encourage more problematization in research without jeopardizing academic recognition or publication success.
